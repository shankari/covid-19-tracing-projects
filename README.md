This site is a crowdsourced list of projects related to **COVID-19 contact tracing using smartphones**.
The goal of contact tracing is to identify the contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and to advise them to self-quarantine.
Large scale, highly accurate contact tracing could control the spread of epidemics and reduce the need for societal lockdowns.

Other list projects:
- A larger list and some additional background can be found in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Kh4_Q_tmyRh0-v452wiul9oQAiTRj8AdZ5vcOJum9Y/edit?ts=5e801c37#).
  Formed by the merging of Stop Covid Now's list, Corona Watch's and Mitra's. 
  Please add projects there as well.
